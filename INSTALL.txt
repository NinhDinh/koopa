= Development Environment =

Koopa is currently being developed using:

* Eclipse 3.5        (http://www.eclipse.org/)
* ANTLR IDE v2.0.0   (http://antlrv3ide.sourceforge.net/)

The ANTLR IDE will need an ANTLR package to function properly. The source
package currently in use is ANTLR v3.1.1. (http://www.antlr.org/)

= Building =

Simply run ANT in the root folder, and sit back. If you're using an IDE you may
need to refresh your workspace afterwards (or let your IDE do this for you).
