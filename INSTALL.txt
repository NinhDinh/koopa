= Development Environment =

Koopa is currently being developed using:

* Eclipse 3.5        (http://www.eclipse.org/)
* ANTLR IDE v2.0.0   (http://antlrv3ide.sourceforge.net/)

The ANTLR IDE will need an ANTLR package to function properly. The source
package currently in use is ANTLR v3.1.1. (http://www.antlr.org/)

= Building =

Run the regenerate target from build.xml, and refresh your eclipse environment
afterwards (you can configure Eclipse to do the latter automatically every
time).
