# A construed analysis for the purpose of showcasing partial tree parsers
# support.
#
# This grammar is a partial reflection of the more complete Cobol grammar. It
# focuses on the matching of the basic structure of a Cobol program, and on
# extracting the names tied to this structure. These names then get processed
# by some utility code in the CobolStructureBase class so we can extract some
# statistics about the frequencies of "words" as they appear in the actual
# names.
#
# The key points to take from this example are:
# * It's just another Koopa grammar, albeit one which gets turned into a 
#   different kind of parsers. But any valid Koopa grammar basically also
#   defines its own tree parser.
# * The names of grammar rules here match the names of the grammar rule nodes
#   in the parse tree.
